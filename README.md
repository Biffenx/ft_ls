# ft_ls
Recode ls and some of its options

Mandatory part
- You must recode the system’s command ls.
- Its behavior must be identical to the original ls command with the following variations:
- Amongst the numerous options available, we are asking you to create the following: -l, -R, -a, -r and -t.
- You do not have to deal with the multiple column format for the exit when the option -l isn’t in the arguments.
- You are not required to deal with ACL and extended attributes.
- The overall display, depending on each option, must stay as identical as possible to the system command.

Bonus part
- Management of ACL and extended attributes.
- Management of the columns without the option -l. 
- Management of options -S, -T, -i, -o, -n, and -1.
- Speed: Very fast.
